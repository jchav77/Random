# **Impound Lien Loss Analysis: Step-by-Step Project Roadmap**

## **Project Objective**

Investigate whether impound companies are systematically targeting high-value vehicles for lien losses, identify coverage gaps in our verification process, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce losses.

-----

## **Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation** (Week 1)

### **Step 1.1: Define the Dataset Scope**

**What you’re doing:** Establish the boundaries of your analysis to ensure data quality.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Pull all lien loss cases from [Month Year] to [Month Year] (12-month period)
- [ ] Filter for **impound-related losses only** (exclude abandoned vehicles, voluntary surrenders, theft recovery)
- [ ] Verify data completeness with titles team
- [ ] Document total case count → This becomes your **[Total N]** for the analysis

**Output:** Clean dataset of **[N total cases]** confirmed as true impound losses

**Pro Tip:** Always confirm your data scope with stakeholders. Ask: “Does this N total cases include abandoned vehicles?” Document the answer.

-----

### **Step 1.2: Gather Vehicle Value Data**

**What you’re doing:** Determine if high-value vehicles are being targeted.

**Actions:**

- [ ] For each case in your dataset, pull the vehicle valuation (KBB, Black Book, or internal valuation)
- [ ] Calculate **average vehicle value** for all impound loss cases → **[Avg Value X]**
- [ ] Pull benchmark data: average vehicle value for ALL repossessed loans (not just impounds) → **[Benchmark Value Y]**
- [ ] Calculate the difference: (X - Y) / Y = **[% Difference]**

**Output:**

- Average impound loss vehicle value: **$[X]K**
- Portfolio benchmark: **$[Y]K**
- Difference: **[+/- Z%]**

**Why this matters:** If impound vehicles are significantly higher value than benchmark, it suggests targeting. If equal or lower, it rules out targeting.

-----

### **Step 1.3: Identify Repeat Offenders**

**What you’re doing:** Find companies with multiple lien loss occurrences.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Group all cases by impound company name
- [ ] Count losses per company over the analysis period
- [ ] Filter for companies with **3 or more losses** → These are “repeat offenders”
- [ ] Document:
  - Total number of repeat offender companies → **[N companies]**
  - Total cases from these companies → **[N cases]**
  - Calculate average vehicle value for repeat offender cases only → **[Avg Value R]**

**Output:**

- **[N]** companies with 3+ losses
- **[M]** total cases from repeat offenders
- Average value: **$[R]K** (compare to benchmark **$[Y]K**)

**Pro Tip:** Export this to a simple table: Company Name | Loss Count | Avg Vehicle Value. You’ll use this later.

-----

## **Phase 2: Coverage Gap Analysis** (Week 1-2)

### **Step 2.1: Understand Your Verification Tools**

**What you’re doing:** Map which states have lien verification coverage.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Meet with titles/operations team to understand current verification tools (e.g., Tool A, Tool B)
- [ ] Obtain list of states where these tools are **active and available**
- [ ] Document any states with **known limitations or exclusions**

**Output:** List of covered states vs. uncovered states

-----

### **Step 2.2: Map Cases to Coverage**

**What you’re doing:** Determine how many losses occur in covered vs. uncovered states.

**Actions:**

- [ ] For each of your **[Total N]** cases, identify the state where the impound occurred
- [ ] Cross-reference with your coverage list from Step 2.1
- [ ] Calculate:
  - Cases in **covered states** → **[N covered cases]** = **[X%]** of total
  - Cases in **uncovered states** → **[N uncovered cases]** = **[Y%]** of total
  - Verify: N covered + N uncovered = Total N ✓

**Output:**

- **[X%]** of cases (**[N]** cases) occur in states WITH verification coverage
- **[Y%]** of cases (**[N]** cases) occur in states WITHOUT verification coverage

**Why this matters:** The uncovered percentage represents your “controllable gap” - losses that could potentially be prevented with tool expansion.

-----

### **Step 2.3: Analyze Verification Process Performance**

**What you’re doing:** For states with coverage, how well does the process work?

**Actions:**

- [ ] For the **[N covered cases]**, determine:
  - How many went through verification process → **[N verified]** (should be 100% if process is strong)
  - Of those verified, how many had successful matches → **[N matched]**
  - How many had no match (slippage) → **[N no-match]**
  - How many had no answer/other → **[N other]**
- [ ] Calculate rates:
  - Verification rate: (N verified / N covered cases) × 100 = **[X%]**
  - Match success rate: (N matched / N verified) × 100 = **[Y%]**
  - No-match rate: (N no-match / N verified) × 100 = **[Z%]**

**Output:**

- Verification compliance: **[X%]** (ideal: 100%)
- Match success: **[Y%]** (ideal: 95%+)
- Slippage: **[Z%]** (goal: minimize)

**Pro Tip:** If slippage is >5%, flag this as needing root cause analysis.

-----

## **Phase 3: Trend & Pattern Analysis** (Week 2)

### **Step 3.1: Monthly Loss Volume**

**What you’re doing:** Understand if losses are stable or trending.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Group your **[Total N]** cases by month
- [ ] Count cases per month
- [ ] Calculate:
  - Average monthly rate → **[X cases/month]**
  - Standard deviation (variability)
  - Identify any months with unusual spikes

**Output:**

- Average monthly loss rate: **[X-Y] cases/month**
- Trend: Stable / Increasing / Decreasing / Seasonal pattern

**Why this matters:** Helps benchmark “normal” and identify if situation is worsening.

-----

### **Step 3.2: Repeat Offender Deep Dive**

**What you’re doing:** Understand WHY certain companies have multiple losses.

**Actions:**

- [ ] For your **[N repeat offender companies]** from Step 1.3:
  - Research company profiles (size, market share, facility count)
  - Check if losses are concentrated in covered or uncovered states
  - Calculate: Of the **[M repeat offender cases]**, how many are in covered states vs. uncovered
- [ ] Look for patterns:
  - Are these high-volume operators? (Expected statistical occurrence)
  - Are losses concentrated in specific states?
  - Is there geographic clustering?

**Output:**

- **[X%]** of repeat offender cases in covered states
- **[Y%]** in uncovered states
- Pattern explanation: High-volume operators / Geographic concentration / Process gaps

-----

## **Phase 4: Synthesis & Quantification** (Week 2-3)

### **Step 4.1: Calculate Total Exposure**

**What you’re doing:** Put dollar figures to the problem.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Multiply total cases by average value:
  - Total annual exposure = **[N cases]** × **$[X]K** = **$[Total]M**
- [ ] Break down by coverage:
  - Covered state exposure = **[N covered]** × **$[X]K** = **$[Y]M**
  - Uncovered state exposure = **[N uncovered]** × **$[X]K** = **$[Z]M**
- [ ] Annualize monthly rate:
  - If average is **[X cases/month]**, annual run rate = **[X × 12] cases/year**

**Output:**

- Total exposure: **~$[X]M annually**
- Controllable gap (uncovered states): **~$[Y]M annually** (**[Z%]** of total)

-----

### **Step 4.2: Assess Fraud Risk**

**What you’re doing:** Determine if there’s evidence of systematic targeting.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Compare values from earlier steps:
  - Repeat offender avg: **$[R]K**
  - All impound cases avg: **$[X]K**
  - Portfolio benchmark: **$[Y]K**
- [ ] Calculate:
  - (Repeat offender avg - Benchmark) / Benchmark = **[% Difference]**
- [ ] Interpret:
  - If repeat offenders are **significantly HIGHER** than benchmark → Red flag, investigate fraud
  - If repeat offenders are **equal or LOWER** → No targeting, likely operational issues

**Output:**

- Fraud risk assessment: **LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH**
- Supporting evidence: Repeat offenders target **[X%] lower/higher** value vehicles than benchmark

-----

## **Phase 5: Recommendations Development** (Week 3)

### **Step 5.1: Prioritize Opportunities**

**What you’re doing:** Rank potential actions by impact and effort.

**Framework:** Create a 2×2 matrix:

```
         High Impact
              ↑
   Quick Wins | Priority 1
              |
   ---------- + ---------- → High Effort
              |
  Deprioritize| Priority 2
              ↓
         Low Impact
```

**Actions:**

- [ ] For each potential action, estimate:
  - **Impact:** How many cases could be prevented? What’s the $ value?
  - **Effort:** How long to implement? What resources needed?

**Example Actions to Evaluate:**

1. Expand verification tools to uncovered states

- Impact: **[N uncovered cases]** = **$[Y]M** annually
- Effort: 6-9 months, requires vendor agreements

1. Root cause analysis of no-match cases

- Impact: **[N no-match cases]** = **$[Z]K** annually
- Effort: 2-4 weeks, internal analysis

1. Establish relationships with repeat offenders

- Impact: **[X-Y]** cases annually = **$[Z]K**
- Effort: 1-2 months, relationship building

**Output:** Prioritized list of 3-5 recommended actions with impact/effort ratings

-----

### **Step 5.2: Build Implementation Roadmap**

**What you’re doing:** Create a realistic timeline for execution.

**Actions:**

- [ ] For each Priority 1 and 2 action:
  - Define specific milestones (e.g., vendor meeting, budget approval, pilot launch)
  - Assign realistic timelines
  - Identify dependencies
  - Note required resources

**Output:** 90-day roadmap with:

- Month 1: Discovery & Planning
- Month 2: Quick Wins & Approvals
- Month 3: Launch & Monitor

-----

### **Step 5.3: Define Success Metrics**

**What you’re doing:** Establish how to measure improvement.

**Actions:**

- [ ] Set 12-month targets:
  - Total case reduction: From **[N current]** to **[N target]** = **[X%] reduction**
  - Coverage expansion: From **[X%]** to **[Y%]**
  - Match rate improvement: From **[X%]** to **[Y%]**
  - Financial impact: Prevent **$[Z]M** in annual losses

**Output:** Clear success criteria that can be tracked monthly/quarterly

-----

## **Phase 6: Stakeholder Communication** (Week 3-4)

### **Step 6.1: Build the Visual Deck**

**What you’re doing:** Translate analysis into executive-ready presentation.

**Slide Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary** (Answer First)

- Headline: Fraud assessment + key finding
- Three pillars: Fraud risk, Coverage gap, Process health
- Charts: Value comparison, Coverage pie, Verification funnel

1. **Deep Dive** (Supporting Evidence)

- Issue tree: How losses break down
- Charts: Repeat offender bar chart, Monthly trend line
- Root cause analysis

1. **Recommendations** (Action Plan)

- Impact-Effort matrix
- 90-day roadmap
- Success metrics

**Pro Tip:** Every chart needs three elements:

1. The data (visual)
1. The insight (what it means)
1. The implication (so what?)

-----

### **Step 6.2: Draft Follow-Up Email**

**What you’re doing:** Summarize findings for stakeholders.

**Email Structure:**

```
Subject: [Follow-Up] Impound Lien Loss Analysis - Key Findings

Hi [Team],

Thanks for your time in our discussion on [Date]. I'm writing to close out 
the follow-up items we discussed.

1. [Most Important Finding First]
   - Confirmed: Dataset includes [N] cases, all true impound losses 
     (abandoned vehicles excluded)

2. [Second Most Important]
   - Coverage analysis shows [X%] of cases in covered states, [Y%] in 
     uncovered states

3. [Supporting Findings]
   - Repeat offender analysis shows [finding]
   - No evidence of targeting detected

Please see attached deck for full analysis and recommendations.

Happy to discuss further.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Pro Tip:** Always lead with “why you’re writing” then move to most important findings.

## **Key Analytical Principles to Follow**

### **1. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**

- Every case should fit into exactly ONE bucket
- All buckets should add up to 100%
- Example: Covered states (X%) + Uncovered states (Y%) = 100% ✓

### **2. Always Have a Benchmark**

- Don’t just say “$[X]K average” - compare to something meaningful
- Portfolio benchmark, industry standard, prior year, etc.
- Comparisons create context

### **3. Quantify Everything**

- Don’t say “many cases” - say “[N] cases ([X%] of total)”
- Don’t say “significant” - say “[X%] higher/lower”
- Numbers make arguments credible

### **4. Answer “So What?” for Every Finding**

- Data point: “23% of cases in uncovered states”
- So what?: “Represents $[Y]M controllable exposure”
- Therefore: “Expanding coverage could prevent [N] annual losses”

### **5. Pyramid Principle**

- Lead with the answer (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
- Then provide 3 supporting pillars
- Then detailed evidence
- Executives should get the message in 30 seconds

-----

## **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

❌ **Starting analysis without confirming data scope** → Always verify what’s included/excluded first

❌ **Showing data without interpretation** → Every chart needs “So what?” commentary

❌ **Making claims without benchmarks** → “$[X]K average” is meaningless without comparison

❌ **Burying the answer** → Lead with findings, don’t make stakeholders hunt for them

❌ **Recommendations without prioritization** → Use impact/effort matrix to rank actions

❌ **Ignoring the “no finding” finding** → “No evidence of fraud” is a valuable conclusion!

-----

## **Quality Checklist Before Presenting**

- [ ] All numbers tie out (totals = sum of parts)
- [ ] Every claim has supporting data
- [ ] Every chart has a title, interpretation, and implication
- [ ] Recommendations are prioritized by ROI
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and time-bound
- [ ] Deck can be understood in 2 minutes OR 20 minutes
- [ ] Email summarizes key points without requiring deck review
- [ ] Stakeholder concerns (fraud, targeting) are explicitly addressed
